Detection of roads from satellite imagery is critical for urban planning, navigation, and disaster management. While classical approaches struggle with terrain variations and occlusions, deep learning architectures like U-Net provide superior accuracy by preserving spatial information. This work implements U-Net for robust road segmentation from high-resolution satellite images.

The project extends beyond basic segmentation to include post-disaster road damage assessment using the xView2 dataset. By comparing pre-disaster and post-disaster imagery, the system quantifies road network damage with metrics such as damage percentage, road survival rate, and catastrophic impact classification. These capabilities enable real-world applications in emergency response, infrastructure damage assessment, and relief operations planning.
